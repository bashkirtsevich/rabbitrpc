If you want to run these examples and you don't have rabbitrpc installed in
your Python path, you'll need to set PYTHONPATH to point to the package.
You will also need to set up your RabbitMQ config in 'config.py' for both
the server and client or you're going to have a bad time :).

Examples from this directory:
PYTHONPATH=../../ python server/server.py

PYTHONPATH=../../ python client/client.py
